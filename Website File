Cameron Tishler Pacboi Game Website

Why did you decide to make this game?: I was inspired by a game called Worldâ€™s Hardest Game. As the title ensues, the game is very difficult. Being one of my favorite arcade games, I decided to go with the theme of Pacman. The reason I didn't make a different game is because so many other games have an element of luck. I think that my game should not have any luck, so that what I did.
